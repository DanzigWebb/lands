I have done a lot of work and now I am happy and proud to present feedback on a fitness project that aims to be a modern, successful and self-confident woman.

									<p> Jennifer's great. Strict but fair </p>
									<p> All questions, adjustments instantly. Food, training - explained in detail. Mobilizes and inspires extraordinarily.</p>

									<p> I watched the video of the very first EL training, I thought it was very easy. And I - an "athlete" need at least the average level. 👌 how I was wrong. I barely survived the first week. The change of diet + all the muscles were hurting.<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">.</span> And that's from entry level. Anyway, I'm shocked by my fitness. It's the third week now, much easier, even waiting for the moment when I start training. And with food, I'm getting a little bit involved. Still, the "cult" stimulates...<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">.</span> And yes, I've already lost two pounds after my vacation.

									<p> If it's time to think about registering for a new course, it's probably time to sum up. I did not know at all what to expect, my decision to join was spontaneous.  The first days were stunningly hard. I supported the idea that it was only 28 days. But in the second week the thought began to emerge, or maybe another month later to take ... it was painfully pleasant feelings in the body. And really, only 30 minutes a day, at home... Not deadly, but very effective. And I want more!<br> Also, I'd be interested to hear the opinions of girls who have been on the program for months. Their thoughts, feelings, successes. Yes,</p>

								<p> And the third day came! Armageddon. It hurts just to keep your legs straight. I can only lean with my legs bent, quacking like an old woman. Although the exercises themselves seemed very simple at first. Monday did well, but added a favorite approach + cardio 6 minutes from last month's hits. The breaks with indignation were cancelled, the load seemed too small. Tuesday- although my feet were already shaking, again + cardio. And why do I think during training that I can do anything? I take my hat off before Jenny, it's not an exercise, it's a disguised time bomb.</p>

A day later I go to the gym with my husband and I can pull more weight, which is also enjoyable. It is already more pleasant to look in the mirror all tightened and my muffin top disappeared 👍.<br> Long live Jennifer. I'd love to continue.</p>

									<p style="text-align: justify;"> My fitness project is a great idea. The main thing is a good coach! Tatiana is an explosion of energy and a sea of good mood every training session. Jennifer knows how to inspire a feat. The project is very good, there are results. In the first month 3.5 kg volume has gone. Meals are available, there is nothing to count, the coach did it for us. Special exercises plus proper nutrition is a good mood and ease in the body.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<h4> Irma, Ottawa, Canada.</h4>
								<blockquote>
									<p style="text-align: justify;"> I've been on the project for six weeks. Saying I'm excited is not saying anything. The result has exceeded my wildest expectations. I lost 8 cm from my waist and hips in five weeks. At the same time, I am not hungry and do not spend much time on training. The project blended perfectly into my life. In addition to everything I feel great, my skin cleared up and I a great mood!!!</p>
								</blockquote>
								<h4> Samantha, US</h4>
								<blockquote>
									<p style="text-align: justify;"> We don't exercise  my body to make me look like a man, but on the contrary, we sharpen my female figure. Bringing her to perfection. And most importantly, it's an opportunity to participate in her online project. It's very disciplined. My menu is scheduled, everything is as accessible as possible. It's hard, though. But I feel like a real athlete, and I already feel responsible to Tatiana, because she is a true coach, who can gather my thoughts in a pile and adjust to the real result. So I urge all the girls. Do not put off tomorrow, what you can start today.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<h4> Vanessa, US</h4>
								<blockquote>
									<p style="text-align: justify;"> I've been practicing with Jennifer for the second week and I've already had minus 2 kg, which I'm very glad about 👏ни with one coach I didn't have such a result! There is still a lot of work ahead of me. Jennifer is a very big professional in her business, I completely trust her! She very strictly controls us, explains how and what to eat, tells us about all the exercises on what and how they work, for us everything is very clear and understandable! For me it's also very important ☝что that she has prepared the menu for us, don't think every time you eat and eat everything is already thought out. I really like doing things with Jennifer! I am very glad that I got to her project, so she will definitely make us slim!</p>

											<div style="text-align: justify;">  I got into training with Jennifer Teagan on February 6, 2017, set myself the goal to lose 8 kg, before that I have already lost 30 kg and the weight stopped, and after the New Year holidays, even gained 3 kg, I was engaged before that I only in the gym and passing by the office, where Jennifer trains, I was afraid to look even there, I thought I would never be able to do this. And so I overcame my fear and signed up with her. At the first training session I went and inside everything was shaking, but after I got such a high that I couldn't describe it with words: cheeks were burning, I couldn't breathe, everything was shaking, but I wanted to experience this feeling again. I do not like to cook, but the diet that Jennifer gave us is very tasty, useful and easy to prepare (I cook for a week). During the first week of training I dropped 2.5 kg - it's cool, and ahead of 7 weeks, maybe even more than planned.  Jennifer Teagan  is a very good, cheerful person, a great coach and our inspirer, I like that if I can't do something, she does not make me do it, but replaces the exercise on the one I can do at this stage. She showed me what my body and body can do. Hopefully during the project we will get to know each other better and be friends, because she has not only group training, but also online projects, so I will not stop there, follow my comments, on March 30 I will write a report on how these 7 weeks in the company of 9 wonderful girls and our guru on modeling our body.</div>

								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"> "I really like the fitness marathon 👯 and I will definitely stay for the next marathon 😊 Jennifer, everything is so clear, understandable and accessible for us that I had few additional questions if only at the beginning. Feedback only positive, I recommend to all) I've become more disciplined 😊, I've learned to plan my own meals, not to eat what I have at home or at work ))) training at home, in the reform has become more frequent) at home very little time, but there is a result. Everyone will have their own, the main thing is to follow the recommendations and not to invent anything 😊I want to instill disciplineand maintain this shape☺ P.S. Sometimes I want a very sweet))).</p>
